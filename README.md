## Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/rimmelasghar/SpringBoot-boilerPlate.git
$ cd SpringBoot-boilerPlate

## Features

1. **Spring Boot 3.1.2**: The application is built using the latest version of Spring Boot, providing a solid foundation for developing robust and efficient Spring applications.

2. **Spring Data JPA**: Spring Data JPA simplifies database access using the Java Persistence API (JPA) and provides easy-to-use repositories for interacting with the database.

3. **Spring Validation**: The application implements Spring Validation to ensure data integrity and validity, making it more reliable and secure.

4. **Spring Security + JWT Token**: Spring Security is integrated into the application to handle authentication and authorization. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure token-based authentication.

5. **MySQL**: The application is configured to use MySQL as the backend database, allowing for persistent data storage.

6. **Mapstruct**: Mapstruct is used to simplify the mapping between DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and entities, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing maintainability.

7. **Lombok**: Lombok reduces the verbosity of Java code by providing annotations to automatically generate boilerplate code for getters, setters, constructors, etc.

8. **Swagger**: The application includes Swagger, a powerful tool for documenting and testing APIs. Swagger UI provides an interactive API documentation that makes it easy for developers to understand and use the API endpoints.

These features collectively form a strong foundation for developing production-ready Spring Boot applications, saving development time and effort and ensuring best practices are followed throughout the development process.
